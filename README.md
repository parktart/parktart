## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

  <p>
  My name is Parker and I'm a Chemical Engineer turned programmer! After gaining experience in roles like manufacturing and research, I'm now pursuing the passion I discovered while programming PLCs in undergrad. This passion is the driving force that excites me every single day to further expand my knowledge in the world of programming!

  <p>
  I recently completed <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> Foundations, a 50-module open-source web development curriculum that teaches the fundamentals of building responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Iâ€™m now looking to contribute as a <strong>Junior Developer</strong> on a team where I am challenged to constantly learn, grow, and refine my skills.

  <p>
  I'm now working on Odin's Full Stack JavaScript curriculum which goes further in depth with..

  <ul>
    <li>Node.js</li>
    <li>Express</li>
    <li>MongoDB</li>
    <li>APIs</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  I am truly excited to apply my innovation, problem-solving, and the many other proficiencies gained through my past experiences to the field of programming!
